# Marvel Heroes

Marvel Heroes is a project based on a code challenge made by a great company in Brazil looking for Software Engineers.

### Developers: 
* [Marcos Vinicius Ferreira](https://github.com/marcosnaofazisso) 

## Goals and Rules:
The main goal was to create a back-end script in Python language Flask that fetched Marvel API and treated the payload data for a React pagination website.

The back-end is in this repository: [Marvel Scripts](https://github.com/marcosnaofazisso/marvel-requests)

And some rules was that pagination as mandatory, along showing all heroes and to be able to choose up to 6 heroes and no more than that.
